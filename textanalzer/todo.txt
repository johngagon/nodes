My goal for this project is to slowly build up the use of some words
Get some nouns out of the list and use my proper nouns list for subject matter
Need to start off with the first verb and pronouns
It should also come off naturally. Besides frequent, allowed words are conversational
101 words and frequently used words in chat. 
Maybe start chatting Jade every day. Maybe make sure my words are not in the 
10000 word list or they get a complexity check. (live)
